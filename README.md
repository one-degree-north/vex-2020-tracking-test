# Position Tracking with PROS for VEX V5 - INCOMPLETE

This is my first attempt at creating a program that tracks the absolute position of a VEX V5 bot with 3 tracking wheels and a skid-style chassis. This program is intended for use with PROS for VEX V5.

## References
This project is largely possible due to the absolute position tracking document listed on team 5225A's website, linked here: https://www.vexforum.com/t/team-5225-introduction-to-position-tracking-document/49640
